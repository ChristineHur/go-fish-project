User versus computer game, each with a hand of 7 cards. Someone asks another if they have a specific card of a number, without regard to the suit. If they do, the card is given to the person who asked, and if not the person who asked picks up a card from the deck. If the player gets a card from their opponent, they get to ask again. The game continues until all the cards are put into piles per number. The winner is the player with more piles.
